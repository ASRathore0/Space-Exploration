        <h2>Formation of Planets</h2>
        <img src="images/formation.jpg" alt="Planet Formation" class="planet-img">
        <p>Planets are thought to form from a nebula that collapses into a rotating disk of gas and dust. A protostar forms at
          the center, while planetesimals (small solid bodies) grow through accretion—where dust particles collide and stick
          together. Over time, these bodies become protoplanets and eventually planets.
        
          Once a star ignites, remaining gas and dust are cleared out, leaving behind planets and smaller bodies. Some moons
          form like planets, while others, like Triton, may be captured by gravity. Early planetary surfaces melt due to impacts
          and radioactive decay, causing differentiation (denser materials sink to form a core).
        
          New observations of exoplanetary systems suggest that a star's metal content influences its likelihood of forming
          planets. Metal-rich stars are more likely to have planetary systems.

        <h2>Planets in the Solar System</h2>
        <img src="images/solar_system.jpg" alt="Solar System" class="planet-img">
        <p>The Solar System consists of eight planets in order of increasing distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth,
          Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Jupiter is the largest planet, with a mass 318 times that of Earth,
          while Mercury is the smallest, with only 0.055 Earth masses. Based on composition, planets are classified into
          three types. Terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are rocky and dense. Gas giants, Jupiter and
          Saturn, are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, while ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, contain water, methane,
          and ammonia.
        
          In addition to planets, the Solar System contains dwarf planets, which are rounded by gravity but have not cleared
          their orbits. These include Ceres, Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake, among others. Ceres, located in the
          asteroid belt, is the smallest, while Pluto and Eris are the largest. Most dwarf planets reside beyond Neptune in
          the Kuiper Belt and scattered disc. They are composed mainly of ice and rock, unlike the rocky terrestrial
          planets.
        
          There are at least 19 planetary-mass moons, meaning they are large enough to take a spherical shape. Notable
          examples include Earth’s Moon, Jupiter’s Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, Saturn’s Titan, Enceladus,
          Uranus’s Titania, Oberon, Neptune’s Triton, and Pluto’s Charon. Some moons, like Europa and Titan, are
          of great scientific interest due to their potential subsurface oceans, which may harbor conditions suitable for
          life.

      <h2>Exoplanets</h2>
      <img src="images/Exoplanets.jpg" alt="Exoplanets" class="planet-img">
      <p>An exoplanet is a planet outside the Solar System, with over 7,026 confirmed exoplanets as of July 2024. They vary
        in size from gas giants larger than Jupiter to Earth-sized rocky planets and even smaller. The first confirmed
        exoplanets were discovered in 1992 orbiting a pulsar, while the first around a main-sequence star was found in 1995
        (51 Pegasi b). The Kepler space telescope has identified many Neptune-sized and smaller planets, including some in
        the habitable zone, where conditions could allow liquid water. Some unique exoplanet types include super-Earths,
        mini-Neptunes, and hot Jupiters, which orbit extremely close to their stars. Others, like COCONUTS-2b, have orbits
        much larger than any planet in the Solar System. Studies suggest that one in five Sun-like stars may have an
        Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone, raising the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

        <h2>Attributes of Planets</h2>
        <img src="images/planet_attributes.webp" alt="Planet Attributes" class="planet-img">
        <p>Although each planet has unique characteristics, they share common dynamic properties, especially in their orbits. In
          the Solar System, planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as its rotation, but some exoplanets, like WASP-17b,
          orbit in the opposite direction. A planet's orbital period or year depends on its distance from the star—the farther
          it is, the longer its orbit. No planet has a perfectly circular orbit; instead, they follow elliptical paths, with the
          closest point to the star called perihelion and the farthest called aphelion. The eccentricity of an orbit determines
          its shape, with low eccentricity meaning a nearly circular orbit, while high eccentricity results in an elongated
          orbit, as seen in some exoplanets and comets. The semi-major axis defines the size of an orbit, and the inclination
          measures how tilted it is relative to a reference plane. In the Solar System, most planets have low inclination, but
          Pluto, Eris, and some comets have highly tilted orbits. Some moons also exhibit unique orbital behavior, such as
          Triton, which orbits Neptune retrograde, meaning in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation.

    <section id="history" class="section fade-in">
        <h2>History and Etymology</h2>
        <img src="images/history.gif" alt="History of Planets" class="planet-img">
        <p>The concept of planets has evolved significantly throughout the history of astronomy, from the divine lights observed
          by ancient civilizations to the scientific understanding we have today. Early astronomers viewed planets as wandering
          stars, with the five classical planets, visible to the naked eye, having a significant impact on mythology, religious
          cosmology, and ancient astronomy. The Babylonians were the first known civilization to have a functional theory of the
          planets, with surviving texts such as the Babylonian Venus tablet and the MUL.APIN, which documented the motions of
          the Sun, Moon, and planets. The Greeks, initially less focused on the planets, developed a heliocentric system by
          Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, though the geocentric model remained dominant until the Scientific
          Revolution.
        
          Medieval astronomers in India and the Islamic world built on these ideas, with figures like Aryabhata and Ibn
          al-Haytham contributing significant advancements. The Scientific Revolution in the 16th century shifted the definition
          of a planet from one that moved across the sky relative to fixed stars to a body that orbited the Sun. This change led
          to Earth being added to the list of planets, and the Sun removed. The discovery of Uranus in 1781, along with other
          major astronomical advancements, further expanded our understanding of planets, with new categories of "satellite
          planets" and "minor planets" like asteroids emerging.
        
          In the 20th century, Pluto was initially classified as the ninth planet, but further observations led to its
          reclassification as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU's definition of a
          planet, which requires an object to orbit the Sun, have sufficient mass for a nearly round shape, and clear its
          orbital neighborhood, resulted in the Solar System being considered to have eight planets. However, the definition
          remains debated, with some astronomers advocating for a geophysical approach based on intrinsic properties like shape
          and mass. The discovery of exoplanets and their unique characteristics has added further complexity to the definition
          of what constitutes a planet, particularly when considering objects with masses approaching that of brown dwarfs or
          those formed through gas-cloud collapse.

      <h2>Mythology and Naming</h2>
      <img src="images/mythology.jpg" alt="Planet Mythology" class="planet-img">
      <p>The naming of planets differs between those in the Solar System and exoplanets. Exoplanets are typically named
        after their parent star with an added designation for their order of discovery, such as Proxima Centauri b. The
        planets in the Solar System (other than Earth) are named based on ancient Babylonian, Greek, and Roman traditions.
        The Babylonians first named the planets after gods, with the Greeks and Romans adopting these names and associating
        them with their gods. For example, Venus was named after the goddess of love, Mars after the god of war, and Jupiter
        after the chief god. Earth’s name, however, is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology, but from Old English, meaning
        "ground" or "dirt." Different cultures use varying naming systems; in India, the planets are named after deities
        like Surya for the Sun and Shani for Saturn, while Persian, Chinese, and Hebrew systems have their own planetary
        names based on gods, elements, or descriptive terms. Additionally, modern moons and asteroids are named with
        associations to their parent planets or mythological figures.</p>
